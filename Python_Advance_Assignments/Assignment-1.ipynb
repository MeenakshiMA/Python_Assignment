    "#### Q1. What is the purpose of Python's OOP?\n",
    "Ans:The purpose of python's OOP is, it makes code more reusable and makes it easier to work with larger programs.           \n",
    "OOP programs prevent you from repeating code because a class can be defined once and reused many times"

    "#### Q4. What makes the first argument in a classâ€™s method function special?\n",
    "Ans:The first argument of every class method, including init, is always a reference to the current instance of the class. By convention, this argument is always named self. In the init method, self refers to the newly created object; in other class methods, it refers to the instance whose method was called."

    "#### Q5. What is the purpose of the __init__ method?\n",
    "Ans:The __init__ function is called every time an object is created from a class. \n",
    "The __init__ method lets the class initialize the object's attributes and serves no other purpose. It is only used within classes."

    "#### Q6. What is the process for creating a class instance?\n",
    "Ans: When you create an object, you are creating an instance of a class, therefore \"instantiating\" a class. The new operator requires a single, postfix argument a call to a constructor. The name of the constructor provides the name of the class to instantiate. The constructor initializes the new object."

    "#### Q7. What is the process for creating a class?\n",
    "Ans: Classes are created by keyword class. Attributes are the variables that belong to a class.         \n",
    "Attributes are always public and can be accessed using the dot (.) operator."

    "#### Q8. How would you define the superclasses of a class?\n",
    "Ans:A superclass is the class from which many subclasses can be created. The subclasses inherit the characteristics of a superclass. The superclass is also known as the parent class or base class"
