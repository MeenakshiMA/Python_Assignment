    "#### Q1. What is the relationship between classes and modules?\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "- Modules are files present inside a package.\n",
    "- whereas a class is used to encapsulate data and functions together inside the same unit.     \n",
    "- Modules are collections of methods and constants.         \n",

    "Ans:  \n",
    "Class attributes are attributes which are owned by the class itself. They will be shared by all the instances of the class. Therefore they have the same value for every instance. We define class attributes outside all the methods, usually they are placed at the top, right below the class header.\n",

    "Such as, we use the \"+\" operator for adding two integers as well as joining two strings or merging two lists.   \n",
    "We can achieve this as the \"+\" operator is overloaded by the \"int\" class and \"str\" class."
